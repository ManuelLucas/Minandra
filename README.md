# CqlQueryBuilder

Cassandra is an Open-Source NoSQL Database that has SQL statements so close to SQL statements from relational database. It's so easy to type all the time these statements, but this work will became very boring and thinking in these daily works that developers need to create repeatedly, we create CqlQueryBuilder.


This Open-Source framework is able to work with POCO objects and generate Cassandra SQL statements without any other boring configurations and the developers won't have bothered with weird settings.
